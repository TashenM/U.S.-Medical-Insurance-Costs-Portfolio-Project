# U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs-Portfolio-Project

This project was about using Python to do an analysis of a dataset containing medical insurance costs in a .csv file. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).

## TL:DR
The dataset for this project contained information about patients' medical insurance costs in the U.S. The goal for the project was to gain insights into some of the factors behind the insurance costs, such as how the insurance costs for smokers vs non-smokers differ. In doing so, a few python libraries were used such as pandas, csv, numpy and matplotlib. The data was collected and stored in a class with methods that were called upon during analysis. A scatter plot and bar graph were used to visualize some insights.
